# Shrink LVM partitions
## I use this in order to backup my distro to smaller drives
sudo apt-get install lvm2
e2fsck -f /dev/yourVG/yourLV 
resize2fs /dev/yourVG/yourLV 150G
lvreduce -L -50G /dev/yourVG/yourLV

# Create the partitions to mirror the drive you wish to backup
## There two ways to do this now, you can either create the partitions with lvcreate or gparted
### If you already set up the LV, you can use gparted
### Create regular ext4s that match the size of your source drive
### In my case I had to make a /boot, /boot/efi and primary partition
### You would create:
### One 512MiB partition for /boot/efi
### One 488MiB partition for /boot
### One partition for you volume group, typically using the rest of the drive
### You will end up dd'ing to these as the OUTPUT(of=/*), NOT the INPUT(if=/*)
### You may want to leave extra space unallocated for a seperate partition for say, another root or dual booting Windows. 

## I will now be going over how to create a logical volume in the case that you do not know how
### Please, if you already created the LVM, skip this step so you do not do any unnecessary work
### You can simply follow the gparted instructions above
### Scan disks with LVM
lvmdiskscan

### Create a new physical volume
pvcreate /dev/mapper/*

### Double check
pvdisplay

### Create a new volume group
vgcreate gentoo /dev/mapper/gentoo
vgdisplay

### Create the partitions, you may not need a swap, var, root or home partition
### This depends on how you installed, if you selected seperate partitions make sure you compensate
### I use 80G for an example but depending on your needs you may need larger partitions.
### If you would like you could also make a smaller or larger swap
lvcreate -C y -L 16G * -n swap
lvcreate -L 80G * -n root
lvcreate -L 80G * -n var
lvcreate -l +100%FREE * -n home

### Check and see if this logical volume is what you want
lvdisplay

# You can now use dd to clone the drive
## PAY ATTENTION WHEN USING DD
### DO NOT SET THE OUTPUT DRIVE AS THE INPUT DRIVE
### I HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE AND IT IS PAINFUL
### ALWAYS TRIPLE CHECK YOUR DD PARAMETERS BEFORE EXECUTING
### Make sure you output to the partitions you created with Gparted above
### These would be the 512MiB /boot/efi, 488MiB /boot 
### As well as the volume group which takes up however much you allocated to it
### Replace with the original as input for the boot directory
## Delete the & symbol
### & sudo dd if= of= bs=64K conv=noerror,sync status=progress
### & sudo dd if= of= bs=64K conv=noerror,sync status=progress
### & sudo dd if= of= bs=64K conv=noerror,sync status=progress
